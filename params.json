  "body": "### WELCOME\r\nWelcome to The Iron Yard UI Design course! I'm so excited to get to know you, to challenge you, and to give you the tools you need to be a successful designer. Although there are still a few weeks until class starts, there is a lot to be done!\r\n\r\n### WHY PREWORK?\r\nUI Design has a lot of different elements to consider. One point I’d like to make clear: UI Design is not just about making things look good, but rather its about juggling a bunch of elements such as: content, imagery, illustration, icon systems, typography, color theory and concepts to create a fully functioning and visually appealing design system. One of the biggest challenges will juggling all of those elements into a cohesive system and involves researching, experimenting, designing, coding, and testing. Learning these skills will take time and it won’t always be easy, and this pre-work will help introduce you to some of the ideas and skills that will form the foundation of your in-person learning experience.\r\n\r\nThis work should be completed before the first day of class. I will assume that you have completed this work before class, so you will likely feel very far behind if you haven’t completed it when we start class on June 27th.\r\n\r\n### OBJECTIVES\r\n- Be able to communicate technical accomplishments and struggles in designing, coding, and writing.\r\n- Be able to learn in contexts that aren't necessarily suited to your primary learning style.\r\n- Adapt to the workflows used by professional Web Designers (we've cover a few common ones in class).\r\n- Commit yourself fulling to learning as much as in can and completing all assignments to the best of your ability.\r\n- Describe the importance of mindset on learning and be able to analyze one's own type of mindset.\r\n\r\n### MINDSET AND LEARNING\r\n1. Read Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives\r\n2. Compose an email with a subject line of \"Mindsets Responses\" to Lexi (lexi@theironyard.com) answering the following questions:\r\n- What aspects of the Growth and Fixed mindset can you identify in your personal history? In what areas do you feel Fixed? - Where do you see the most Growth?\r\n- What difficulties do you predict that you will encounter during our course? How have you reacted to similar situations in the past? How do you plan on reacting to these situations during the class?\r\n\r\n### COMPUTER SETUP\r\nMake sure you have the most updated version of OSX. In order to install:\r\n1. You'll need to sign in to the Mac App Store with you Apple ID. If you don't have one, sign up here.\r\n2. Download the upgrade from the Apple Store here.\r\n3. Double-click \"Install OS X (Newest Version)\" to begin installation. WARNING: The OS X upgrade can take a bit of time to complete and will require a restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch break.\r\n\r\n### ADOBE SUITE\r\nSign up for Adobe Creative Cloud (if you don't already have Adobe CS4 or higher). You can use everything free for the first 30 days but the will have to pay for at least the 12 weeks of class. There are two options we recommend:\r\n\r\n**Option 1**\r\nThe CC annual account, paid monthly: $49.99 for all of the programs if the you agree to one year contract Total student cost for 4 months = $200 plus tax (plus remaining 8 months = $600 plus tax)\r\n\r\n**Option 2**\r\nThe CC monthly account month-to-month pricing: $74.99 for all of the programs (without cancellation fees) Total student cost for 4 months = $300 plus tax\r\n\r\n### BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES\r\n- [An Introduction to Hierarchy](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/an-introduction-to-hierarchy--webdesign-14947)\r\n- [Anatomy of Typography](http://www.designersinsights.com/designer-resources/anatomy-of-typography)\r\n- [Understanding Color Models and Spot Color Systems](http://www.designersinsights.com/designer-resources/understanding-color-models)\r\n- [Gestalt Principles](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-of-gestalt/)\r\n- [Introduction to User-Centered Design](http://www.usabilityfirst.com/about-usability/introduction-to-user-centered-design)\r\n- [Principles of User Interface Design](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/)\r\n- [10 User Interface Design Fundamentals](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/10-user-interface-design-fundamentals)\r\n\r\n### HTML AND CSS BASICS\r\nHTML and CSS are the foundation of all the content of webpages, web sites, or web apps. However, we will only be spending about a week on HTML and CSS, so you should have a basic foundation before the class starts.\r\n\r\nComplete the course: [CodeAcademy – Web Track](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web), which covers HTML and CSS. This should take you approximately 7-12 hours, depending on your prior experience.\r\n\r\n### MARKDOWN\r\nLearn Markdown, a simple language that converts simple text to code through this tutorial.\r\n\r\n### TYPING\r\nBelieve it or not, a lot of time in the first weeks of coding and programming is spent fixing simple typing errors. It would not be ridiculous to suggest that many of you will spend 12-24 hours (or more) fixing typing errors during class.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know how to touch type (i.e. type without looking at the keyboard), try to spend some time each day working on touch typing (you can try [KEYBR](http://www.keybr.com/#!game)). Typing for programming is actually a good bit different than everyday typing, so getting some practice in could potentially save you a ton of time the first few weeks of class.\r\n\r\n### BONUS\r\nIf you're really rearin' to go, here are a few Photoshop and Illustrator video tutorials to check out!\r\n\r\n#### Photoshop (~ 2 Hours)\r\n- [Photoshop Workspace](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/introduction-work-area.html?set=photoshop--fundamentals--photoshop-workspace)\r\n- [Working With Zoom](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/photoshop-zoom-tool.html?set=photoshop--fundamentals--photoshop-workspace)\r\n- [Working With Layers](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/layer-basics-explained.html?set=photoshop--fundamentals--layers)\r\n- [Organizing Layers](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/photoshop-reduce-chaos-layer-groups.html?set=photoshop--fundamentals--layers)\r\n- [Design Workflow](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/design-tools-workflow.html?set=photoshop--fundamentals--design-techniques)\r\n- [Aligning Objects](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/photoshop-align-images-multiple-layers.html?set=photoshop--fundamentals--layers)\r\n- [Select Part of a Photo](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/select-part-photo.html?set=photoshop--fundamentals--select-image-part)\r\n- [Understanding Resolution](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/image-resolution-explained.html?set=photoshop--fundamentals--essential-tasks)\r\n- [Using the Magical History Palette](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/photoshop-undo-history-panel.html?set=photoshop--fundamentals--essential-tasks)\r\n- [Saving a JPG](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/save-as-jpeg.html?set=photoshop--fundamentals--print-share-photo)\r\n\r\n#### Illustrator (~ 3 Hours)\r\n- [Overview](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/what-is-illustrator.html?set=illustrator--get-started--overview)\r\n- [How to Setup a New Document](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/create-new-document.html?set=illustrator--get-started--essential-beginners)\r\n- [Working With Layers](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/how-to/layer-basics-explained.html?set=photoshop--fundamentals--layers)\r\n- [Work with Artboards](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/work-with-artboards.html?set=illustrator--get-started--essential-beginners)\r\n- [Use the Shape Tool](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/use-shape-tools.html?set=illustrator--get-started--essential-beginners)\r\n- [Applying Color](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/apply-colors.html?set=illustrator--get-started--essential-beginners)\r\n- [Saving a File](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/save-export-for-output.html?set=illustrator--get-started--essential-beginners)\r\n- [How to Design a Logo in Illustrator](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/design-logo.html?set=illustrator--get-started--ready-to-use)\r\n- [Layers in Illustrator (very different than Photoshop)](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/stay-organized-with-layers.html?set=illustrator--fundamentals--illustrator-workspace)\r\n- [Bitmap vs. Vector](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/illustrator-bitmap-vs-vector.html?set=illustrator--fundamentals--create-artwork)\r\n- [Understanding Paths](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/how-to/illustrator-understanding-paths.html?set=illustrator--fundamentals--create-artwork)",
